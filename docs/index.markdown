    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Tim KÃ¶nig, I hold a PhD in Political Sciences from the University of Hildesheim. I have specialised in data analysis, employing various methods such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Network Analysis. My dissertation was concerned with the epistemology of these methods, associated shifts in the paradigms of the social sciences and the role of digital technology for political communication. It is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.18442/041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (partly in German). My current work is concerned with Large Language Models, and their employment for various analyses in computational social sciences.<br> <br> 
    You can find more information on my work in data analysis & NLP <a href="/data-analysis">here</a>. Among other things, I've authored the <a href="https://github.com/TimBMK/textgraph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">textgraph</a> package for R and a <a href="https://github.com/TimBMK/langchain-zotero-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zotero Retriever</a> for the LangChain Framework. You can also check out my <a href="/publications/">publications</a>, the <a href="/talks/">talks</a> I've given, and the <a href="/teaching/">seminars </a> I've taught. I have also taught some <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a> on topics such as large-scale data analysis, Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.<br><br>
