Welcome to my website! My name is Tim KÃ¶nig, I hold a PhD in Political Sciences from the University of Hildesheim. I have specialised in data analysis, employing various methods such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Network Analysis. My dissertation was concerned with the epistemology of these methods, associated shifts in the paradigms of the social sciences and the role of digital technology for political communication. It is available [here](https://doi.org/10.18442/041) (partly in German). My current work is concerned with Large Language Models, and their employment for various analyses in computational social sciences.
